          <p>This project named « Memorial » is a 3 photography series shot in the Arlington National Cemetery in 2017. This cemetery is a military cemetery where soldiers from all wars, from Vietnam to Iraq, are buried.</p>
          <p>The purpose of this project was to transpose my feelings when I visited this cemetery and the very special atmosphere that prevails on this place.</p>
          <p>The main thing I wanted to express thanks to these photographies is the paradox which marks this place.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
          <h1 class="titleSlide">Explanations</h1>
          <p>First, there were tombs for as far as the eyes can see and it gave the feeling that all the soldiers acted like a single person. It tends to make the people forget that these soldiers were individuals and humans before anything
            else.</p>
          <p>This idea of soldiers acting like a whole is principally expressed on the third picture as it begins from a single tombe on the foreground and it grows until it’s get impossible to clearly distinguish each single tomb on the background.</p>
          <p>It's also accentuated by the lack of name on the first tomb, as if this soldier could have been everyone.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
          <h1 class="titleSlide">Explanations</h1>
          <p>Then, when I was walking on the paths of this cemetery, it appeared essential to me to make the viewer remember that all these soldiers, each of these individuals has gave their life to serve their country and they can’t be
            perceived just as a whole.</p>
          <p>I tried to express this through the first and the second photography. The first photography represents the flame of the unknown soldier which pay tribute to every single soldiers dead who the corpse haven’t been recovered; and the
            second one focus on a single tomb on which a name is inscribed</p>
