          Corporate identity for PETITE FAIM

          "PETITE FAIM"

          <h1>Objective</h1>
          <p>I had to create an entire corporate identity based on the name, the business sector and the location.</p>
          <p>The one I chosen is named "Petite Faim" and is based into the «République» district in Dijon. It's appears perfect to me because this area hosts a lot of students and the food delivery particularly speaks to them these times.</p>

      <article class="section petiteFaimDetails">
        <div class="slide">
          <h1>Details</h1>
          <p>By creating this corporate identity, I had to care about the visual part as well as the values. Concerning the values, since République is a student district, I thought that youth should be a great first value. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="slide">
          <h1>Details</h1>
          <p>Furthermore, all the companies in this business sector offer pretty the same pricing. What make the difference is the customer relation and in this very youth quarters it’s only improving this.</p>
          <p>Then an other value that appears essential to me was the care about the environment because it's getting more and more important and it’s becoming a sales pitch especially for the youth target audience.</p>
